# Inventory management system

## Description

The goal of the project is to improve the ligistic system by saving time of the logistics departement. This is done by giving a light signal in the hallway by pressing a button inside the lab. The signal is transmitted via wifi. Next to the button there is a led who follow the same status as the led outside to inform the user of the status.
The application was tailor made for the anatomo-pathologic lab of AZ Zeno. The application is writn in a combination of C/C++ that is called “Arduino programming language”.
Yoram Vandenhouwe was the main contributor of this project.
Work on the project started on 13/02/2024. The Logistics management system was diliverd to the anatomo-pathologic lab of AZ Zeno on 23/05/2024.

## Development stetup

For the hardware the project uses 3 ESP32 computers with wifi capacity. These need a voltage of 3.3V. This can be supplied by a Micro-USB type B. These are also used to upload the code.
The installation also requires a pushbottons, leds, transistors and wire.

The code may be downloaded. Work on the code can be done in the IDE of the users chosing. 

Visual studio code was used to develop the project.

The Arduino IDE was used to compile and upload the code to the ESP32's.

## Instalation

A guide for the circuit and how to upload the code can be found in the manual.

## Usage
    
A manual is provided for a full explanation. The manual is in dutch.

## Credits

The project was realized with the help of ir Rob Vanden Broucke and Dr B.Lelie who, respectivly, guided with the coding and to functionality.
